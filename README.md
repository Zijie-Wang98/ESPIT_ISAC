To obtain numerical results for Fig. 2, please run "PD_lambda/analytical.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 4, please run "Compute_Ks.m" and "Pareto_bound/Main/Get_Pareto_bounds.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 5, please run "Pareto_bound/Correlation/Compute_Ks.m" (for various r values) and "Pareto_bound/Correlation/Get_Perato_bounds.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 6, please run "Pareto_bound/SNR/Get_SNR_curves.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 7, please run "Current_density/Get_current_densities.m";

Thanks for your attention and interest!
