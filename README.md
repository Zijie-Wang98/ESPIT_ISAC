# PM-Enabled ISAC System

This is the open-source MATLAB code to generate the numerical results in the paper "On the Fundamental Detection-Rate Performance Limits and Pareto-Optimal Waveform Design in Programmable-Metasurface-Enabled ISAC Systems" by Zi-Jie Wang, Xudong Wang, and Zhi Ning Chen.

Note: *****These scripts only generate raw numerical data for all figures. Plotting scripts are not included; readers may visualize the results using straightforward and standard MATLAB plotting commands if desired.***** All rights reserved @ National University of Singapore and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 2, please run "PD_lambda/analytical.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 4, please run "Compute_Ks.m" and "Pareto_bound/Main/Get_Pareto_bounds.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 5, please run "Pareto_bound/Correlation/Compute_Ks.m" (for various r values) and "Pareto_bound/Correlation/Get_Perato_bounds.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 6, please run "Pareto_bound/SNR/Get_SNR_curves.m";

To obtain numerical results for Fig. 7, please run "Current_density/Get_current_densities.m";

Thanks for your attention and interest!
