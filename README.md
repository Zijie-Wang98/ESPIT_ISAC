# ESPIT_ISAC

This is the open-source MATLAB code to generate the numerical results in the paper "Programmable-Metasurface-Enabled ISAC Systems: Detection-Information Performance Limits and Waveform Design" by Zi-Jie Wang, Xudong Wang, and Zhi Ning Chen.

The scripts for figure plots are not included. All rights reserved @ Shanghai Jiao Tong University and National University of Singapore.

To generate numerical results for Fig. 2, please run "Numerical_results/PD_lambda/analytical.m";

To generate numerical results for Fig. 4, please run "Numerical_results/Compute_Ks.m" and "Numerical_results/Pareto_bound/Main/Get_Pareto_bounds.m";

To generate numerical results for Fig. 5, please run "Numerical_results/Pareto_bound/Correlation/Compute_Ks.m" (for various r values) and "Numerical_results/Pareto_bound/Correlation/Get_Perato_bounds.m";

To generate numerical results for Fig. 6, please run "Numerical_results/Pareto_bound/SNR/Get_SNR_curves.m";

To generate numerical results for Fig. 7, please run "Numerical_results/Current_density/Get_current_densities.m";

Thanks for your attention and interest!
